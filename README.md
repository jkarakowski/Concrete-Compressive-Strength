#### Exploring Concrete Compressive Strength dataset using Neural Networks

The Concrete dataset from UCI located [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength) is analyzed with the objective of predicting compressive strength from other concrete attributes.  As suggested by Brett Lantz in Chapter 7 of *Machine Learning with R*, neural networks of varying complexity are created and trained.  The work here is done in Python using the scikit-learn and keras libraries, with additional exploration beyond what is done by Lantz.
